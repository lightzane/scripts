# Scripts

Custom scripts to inject javascript codes to your local browser in such use-case for example where you want to change a Chess theme that is not available in their collection.

## How to use

Pick a theme at [lichess](./lichess/) folder, for example: **fritz**

Copy entire scripts and just paste it on the browser's console.
